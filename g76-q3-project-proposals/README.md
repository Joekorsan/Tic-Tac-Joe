## Write a project proposal and get it approved by an instructor

You will need to come up with a product idea, and write it as a proposal that includes:

* A project description
* Who uses it?
* What outputs do they need?
* What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
* A list of technologies that you plan to use
* A well-defined and written-out feature list

# proposal

### project description:
This game is called tic-tac-joe, it's a blend of tic-tac-toe (ttt) and chess like strategy. this game was founded by my bothers and I when we were kids as a way to add to ttt the one play feeling. we didn't like that you had to start all over every time that we tied. this game solves that problem and adds a new spin to an old game. this game is going to be arcady.

### Who uses it:
This game is for all ages and for anyone that love tic-tac-toe and love strategy games, because it combines both.

### what outputs do they need:
fun, scores, leaderbords, multiplayer, streak

### what inputs are needed to generate those outputs:
player info to create an account and start playing.

### list technologies:
socket.io, nodejs, react, redux, express, postgreSQL, knexJS

### features:
* leaderbords for users to view people with the most wins in a row.

Fork this repository and submit a pull request with your proposal in the following format: <firstname>-<lastname>-q3-proposal.

## Follow Agile Workflow

* The methodologies, tools, and roles you use are up to you.

## Create and deploy a complete fullstack app

Your app should:

### BASE GOAL

* Must be full CRUD for at least one model (i.e. posts/comments/etc)
* Must contain server routes handling full CRUD.
* Must use a front end framework (AngularJS, Angular5, React, Vue, etc.)
* Must use client side routing(ui-router, react-router v4, etc.)
* Must contain parent/child components and pass data/functions down from parent component to child component somewhere
* Must use a state management library (Redux / Vuex / ngRx /etc.)
* If any version of Angular/AngularJS is used, it must contain services.

### STRETCH GOALS

* Use Authentication (Login/Logout)
* Use some significant technology that was not covered in the program. This is not required, though. Examples include:
* Using Ember, Angular 4, AngularJS, Vue, etc. on the front-end instead of Angular 1.6
* Making a native mobile app using a wrapper like ionic framework/React Native/PhoneGap/Cordova etc.
* Making a desktop app with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)/[React Native Desktop](https://github.com/ptmt/react-native-desktop) etc.
* Integrating a physical device/sensor/internet of things
* Using Rails, .NET, SailsJS, or some other backend framework for building APIs

#### OTHER REQUIREMENTS

* All of the quality standards from earlier projects are the same as far as clean code, commit messages, READMEs, etc.

<a id="write-up"></a>

## Add all three of these to an online portfolio

* Create a portfolio on the [student portal](http://students.galvanize.com)
* Link to your final deployed site, your video, your repositories, and your write-up
* This will be added to your web development portfolio

## Present your work to the class

* Be prepared to spend ~10 minutes presenting your work to the class.

---

This is a realistic approximation of what developing real products is like. You will have approximately 20-25 hours of class time to work on this. **It will not be enough time to do a good job on this project**. Plan on spending extra time outside of class! This is another Big Deal Week, and you should put maximum effort into making it successful. You can and should use your classmates and your instructors as learning resources, but this should be your own work.
